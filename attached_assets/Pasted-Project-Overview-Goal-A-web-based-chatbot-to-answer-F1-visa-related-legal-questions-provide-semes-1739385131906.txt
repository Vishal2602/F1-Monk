Project Overview
Goal: A web-based chatbot to answer F1 visa-related legal questions, provide semester alerts, and link to scheduling tools.
MVP Features:

Legal Q&A (work authorization, course load rules).

Notification board for alerts/news (e.g., OPT deadlines).

Hyperlink to schedule meetings (no calendar integration).
No-Code/Low-Code Focus: Fast deployment with flexibility for future AI upgrades.

Tech Stack Recommendation
1. Chatbot Builder: Dialogflow ES (Free Tier)
Why: No-code intent design, handles FAQs, integrates with React.

Setup:

Create intents for topics like:

WorkAuthorizationIntent (CPT/OPT rules).

CourseLoadIntent (minimum credits per semester).

AlertsIntent (links to notification board).

Add training phrases like:
“Can I work off-campus?” → Response: “F1 students may work up to 20 hours/week on-campus during semesters.”

2. Frontend (Webapp): React.js + Material-UI
Why: Easy to embed Dialogflow, clean UI for notifications.

Components:

Chat interface (using react-chat-widget).

Notification board (static or API-driven list of alerts).

3. Notification Board: Firebase Firestore (Free Tier)
Why: Real-time updates without complex coding.

Setup:

Store alerts as documents (e.g., { title: "OPT Deadline", date: "2024-03-01", details: "..." }).

Fetch and display them in React.

4. Deployment: Vercel/Netlify (Free Hosting)
Host React app + Firebase integration.

Step-by-Step Plan
Week 1 (MVP):
Build the Q&A Flow in Dialogflow:

Add 10-20 sample intents (e.g., “What happens if I drop below full-time credits?”).

Use USCIS F1 Guidelines as a knowledge source.

Sample Response:

plaintext
Copy
"F1 students must maintain full-time enrollment (12+ credits). Dropping below may risk visa status. Contact your DSO immediately."  
Create a Simple React Webapp:

Embed Dialogflow using @botonic/react or react-chat-widget.

Add a static notification section (hardcode 3-5 test alerts).

Add Hyperlink to Schedule Meetings:

Use a button in Dialogflow:

json
Copy
"text": "Schedule an appointment: [University Portal](https://your-university-schedule-link.com)"  
Week 2-3 (Enhancements):
Connect Firebase for Notifications:

Fetch alerts dynamically from Firestore.

Add Fallback Intent Handling:

Train Dialogflow to respond with “Please consult your DSO for specifics” for unhandled queries.

Basic Analytics:

Track common questions with Dialogflow’s built-in analytics.

Long-Term Upgrades (Advanced AI):
Integrate Rasa or TensorFlow:

Use NLP to parse complex student queries (e.g., “I’m graduating in December; when does my OPT start?”).

Automated Alerts:

Scrape university websites for deadline updates using Python + BeautifulSoup.

Multilingual Support:

Add Google Translate API for international students.

Security & Compliance
No Personal Data: Ensure Dialogflow/Firebase settings disable logging.

HTTPS: Enforce SSL on your webapp (Vercel/Netlify do this by default).

Disclaimer: Add “This bot provides general guidance only. Consult your DSO for official advice.”
